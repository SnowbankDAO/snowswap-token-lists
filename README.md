# @uniswap/token-lists

[![Tests](https://github.com/Uniswap/token-lists/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Uniswap/token-lists/actions?query=workflow%3ATests)

This package includes a JSON schema for token lists, and TypeScript utilities for working with token lists.

The JSON schema represents the specification for a token list which can be used in the Uniswap Interface.

## JSON Schema $id

The JSON schema ID is [https://uniswap.org/tokenlist.schema.json](https://uniswap.org/tokenlist.schema.json)

## Validating token lists

This package does not include code for token list validation. You can easily do this by including a library such as 
[ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) to perform the validation against the JSON schema. The schema is exported from the package
for ease of use.

## Authoring token lists

### Manual

The best way to manually author token lists is to use an editor that supports JSON schema validation. Most popular
code editors do, such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html#ws_json_schema_add_custom) or 
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings). Other editors
can be found [here](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#editors).

The schema is registered in the [SchemaStore](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore), and any file that matches
the pattern `*.tokenlist.json` should 
[automatically utilize](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html#ws_json_using_schemas) 
the schema (when supported by your text editor.)

In order for your token list to be able to be used, it must pass JSON schema validation.

### Automated

If you want to automate token listing, e.g. by pulling from a smart contract, or other sources, you can use the 
npm package to take advantage of the JSON schema for validation and the TypeScript types. 
Otherwise, you are simply working with JSON. All the usual tools apply, e.g.:

```typescript
import { TokenList, schema } from '@uniswap/token-lists'

// generate your token list however you like.
const myList: TokenList = generateMyTokenList();

// use a tool like `ajv` to validate your generated token list
validateMyTokenList(myList, schema);

process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(myList));
```

## Semantic versioning

Lists include a `version` field, which follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

List versions must follow the rules:

- Increment major version when tokens are removed
- Increment minor version when tokens are added
- Increment patch version when tokens already on the list have minor details changed (name, symbol, logo URL)

Changing a token address or chain ID is considered both a remove and an add, and should be a major version update.

## Examples

You can find a valid example of a token list [here](test/schema/example.tokenlist.json).
